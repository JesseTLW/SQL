# This project utilizes the following marathon data:

CREATE TABLE marathon (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
   participant_name TEXT,
   previous_experience TEXT,
   completion_fraction REAL);

INSERT INTO marathon (participant_name, previous_experience,  completion_fraction)
    VALUES ("Sadie Hawkins", "yes", 1);
INSERT INTO marathon (participant_name, previous_experience,  completion_fraction)
    VALUES ("Brandon Flowers", "no", 0.241);
INSERT INTO marathon (participant_name, previous_experience,  completion_fraction)
    VALUES ("Michael Scott", "no", 0.804);
INSERT INTO marathon (participant_name, previous_experience,  completion_fraction)
    VALUES ("Karamo Brown", "yes", 0.9512);
INSERT INTO marathon (participant_name, previous_experience,  completion_fraction)
    VALUES ("Antoni Porowski", "yes", 0.640);
INSERT INTO marathon (participant_name, previous_experience,  completion_fraction)
    VALUES ("Rajnighanda Kapoor", "no", 1);
